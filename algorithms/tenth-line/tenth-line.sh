## How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
## 
## For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
## 
## Line 1
## Line 2
## Line 3
## Line 4
## Line 5
## Line 6
## Line 7
## Line 8
## Line 9
## Line 10
## Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
## Line 10

# Read from the file file.txt and output the tenth line to stdout.
tail -n+10 file.txt | head -n1
