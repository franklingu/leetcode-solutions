Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:

![Image1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
Example 2:

![Image1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        bfs = [root]
        i = 0
        while bfs[i]:
            bfs.append(bfs[i].left)
            bfs.append(bfs[i].right)
            i += 1
        return not any(bfs[i:])
